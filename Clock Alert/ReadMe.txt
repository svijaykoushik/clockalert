Dont know time flying by when engaged with the computer?
then **Clock Alert** is the right solution for you.
Clock alert is an application that sits on the system tray and monitors your system clock. When an hour gets complete it rings with music like a cuckoo clock. In other words when your system clock strikes 1,2, and upto 12 it rings with a sound.
